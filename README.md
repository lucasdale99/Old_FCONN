# FCONN
This is a capstone project for my last semester of undergrad. We are continuing the work of a previous semester on a web application called FCONN. It is like the app Strava, but for food. 

In order to open up and make changes to this project, follow these steps.
1. Install xampp and dbeaver.
2. Add this to htdocs in the xampp folder.
3. Open up in visual studio code.
4. Run and debug in Chrome.
    - This should open up the project in chrome with your changes.
